    """ SPM HRF function from sum of two gamma PDFs

    This function is similar to SPMs `spm_hrf.m` function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t : array-like
        vector of times at which to sample HRF.
    peak_delay : float, optional
        delay of peak.
    under_delay : float, optional
        delay of undershoot.
    peak_disp : float, optional
        width (dispersion) of peak.
    under_disp : float, optional
        width (dispersion) of undershoot.
    p_u_ratio : float, optional
        peak to undershoot ratio.  Undershoot divided by this value before
        subtracting from peak.
    normalize : {True, False}, optional
        If True, divide HRF values by their sum before returning.  SPM does this
        by default.

    Returns
    -------
    hrf : array
        vector length ``len(t)`` of samples from HRF at times `t`.

    Notes
    -----
    See ``spm_hrf.m`` in the SPM distribution.
